      This is a quick and easy recipe for pork chops in a flavorful honey-garlic
      sauce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (5 ounce) pork chops</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup honey</li>
      <li>¼ cup wate</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
          oven's broiler.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sear
          pork chops until golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per
          side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reduce heat to medium and melt butter in the pan juices, scraping up
          any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add garlic and cook until
          fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, and vinegar. Increase
          heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce has
          reduced down and slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return pork back
          to the skillet and baste generously with the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transfer skillet under the broiler and broil until edges of pork chops
          are slightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recipe Tip</h2>
    <p>
      You can use bone-in or boneless pork chops. Chicken broth can be used
      instead of water, and you can substitute the rice wine vinegar with any
      white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.
